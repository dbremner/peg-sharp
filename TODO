See Bison's simple error recovery.* Would be nice to support #if stuff.* Might want a --setting switch. Should override earlier switches and peg file settings.* Allow arbitrary sequences (instead of just strings) to be parsed?* Release checklist:	- make sure the csproj has the right version	- make sure sln still builds	 /Users/jessejones/Documents/Developer/UnixNotes.sh /Users/jessejones/Documents/Developer/c#.cs e{0,x} always matchese{0,0} always matches never consumes input
