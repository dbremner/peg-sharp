See Bison's simple error recovery.* Would be nice to support #if stuff.* May want to support utf-16 (could look for zeros or a bom).* Might want a --setting switch. Should override earlier switches and peg file settings.* Allow arbitrary sequences (instead of just strings) to be parsed?* Would be nice if we could do optimizations like rule inlining but this is tricky with the   way we handle semantic actions (they are attached to rules not expressions, rely on   the order of expressions within the rule, and default to returning the value of the   first subrule).* Release checklist:	- make sure the csproj has the right version	- make sure sln still builds
