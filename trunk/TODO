Also wiki.* Might want optional support for generating (and rewriting?) nodes. ANTLR has some   support for this.* Should there be an explicit way to match eot?* Work on optimization:	- could inline simple rules (eg Space) before they are written	- could get rid of helpers like DoSequence	- look into using pointers to avoid string [] range checks	- [...] / [...]* Might be nice to add some support for error recovery so multiple parse errors can be   reported. See Bison's simple error recovery.* Would be nice to support #if stuff.* Might want a --setting switch. Should override earlier switches and peg file settings.* Allow arbitrary sequences (instead of just strings) to be parsed?	 /Users/jessejones/Documents/Developer/UnixNotes.sh /Users/jessejones/Documents/Developer/c#.cs  partial private void onNameChanged();
