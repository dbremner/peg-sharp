peg-sharp is a tool which is used to generate C# code for arbitrary Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs). The generated code implementsa packrat parser so it is reasonably efficient. See <http://code.google.com/p/peg-sharp/>for more details.Currently the tool is built via a make file, but it's trivial to setupa Visual Studio solution to build it. To build the example you can use the make file, or if you have the binary distribution, you can use something like:   mono bin/peg-sharp.exe --out=example/Parser.cs example/Parser.peg   gmcs -out:bin/example.exe -target:exe example/*.cs -- jesjones@mindspring.com
